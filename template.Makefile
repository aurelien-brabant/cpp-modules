# This file contains all the Makefile variables and rules that will never change
# across modules and exercises. It is to be included at the top of every C++
# exercise own's Makefile.
#
# This template assumes that some variables are already defined before inclusion:
# - TARGET, which must hold the name of the executable.
# - SRCS, which must hold the list of .cpp files that are needed to compile the program. 
# - HEADERS, which must hold the list of .{h, hpp} files the program depends on.
